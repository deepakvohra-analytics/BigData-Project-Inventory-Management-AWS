Smart Inventory Management Using Sales forecasting on AWS Ecosystem


## Motivation
With the advent of the era of big data, cloud computing can effectively improve the operational efficiency of enterprises. Its convenient information acquisition and simple operation can effectively reduce the cost of material inventory management and improve the level of inventory control and management. 

## Use Case
Our team will give a use case of supply chain inventory management using AWS to compute sales, storage, and associated resources required to support those peaks which would impose a sizable cost burden on the business, and risk these resources being underused during non-peak periods or risk inventory shortages during peak periods.

Objective 1: Sales forecasting on monthly basis for warehouse inventory management

Objective 2: Sales analysis for optimizing inventory on a weekly-basis especially for very fast moving products or perishable products such as bakery items.
